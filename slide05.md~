* Software *Documentation* is not the same as commentation
* Documentation is necessary to describe a software product to its consumers. This includes information such as manuals that describe how a product is used, as well as documents that explain *how* a product works
* Since describing how a program runs is often directly related to the programs source code certain tools exist that can generate documentation from comments embedded in the source code itself.
* These programs are called doucmentation generators
