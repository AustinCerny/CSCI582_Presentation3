# Summary

***
#### Doxygen is a robust documentation generation tool that can generate detailed, organized information about the functions and structures of a piece of source code. Doxygen works by parsing the commentation of a piece of source code and finding special prefixes that follow a basic documentation outline. Additional feature can generate graphical illustrations of how the code works such as call graphs. However, the advantages in documentation that Doxygen supplies often comes at the expense of commentation, as the implimentation of odxygen can make the existing source code harder to follow. Regardless, doxygen serves a powerful tool for helping simplify the essential software development task of proper code documentation.
