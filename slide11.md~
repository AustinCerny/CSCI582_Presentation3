***
#### Documentation is generated primarily as brief descriptions and detailed descriptions around entities 
#### Entities can be any block of code that is enclosed in parathesis. This generally, this allows for each function to be given a function to have a prief description and a more details
##### The first line of any section of Doxygen style documentation becomes a brief description of the next section of code enclosed by parethesis. The next lines are part of the detailed description
* The brief description can be entended to muliple lines by using the escape sequence `\brief` on subsequent lines
* Using a carrot symbol `^` after the comment string will force the desription apply to the previous set block of code instead of the next.
