# Introduction (II)
*** 

* Some developers assume that well written code should be self explanitory and need no documentation
* Other coders feel code needs to be extensively commented to make sense. In many open source projects commentation accounts for over 50% of non whitespace characters [1](https://github.com/AustinCerny/CSCI582_Presentation3/blob/master/sources.md)
* Comments are unecessary if they are excessive or unhelpful  
For instance
```
Int count = 100; /* Assign value 100 to count integer variable */
```
