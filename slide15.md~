# Advanced Doxygen Usage (III)

***
#### Doxygen has built in groups based on common documentation standards. Adding to these groupings behaves similarly to using inline commands
* @return *special section for what a function returns*
* @param parameter *description of a parameter (parameter must be named)*
* @warning *special warning about a section of code, appears in red*
* @note *special note about a section of code, appears in yellow*
* @see *additional references (shorthand for see also)*
