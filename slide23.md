# Benifits, Drawbacks and Future Developments (III)

***
#### Using Doxygen is not compatable with all types of software lifecycles, (test driven development for instance)
#### It also isn't compatable with all major development platforms
* plugins exist for Visual Studio
* Eclox plugin was meant to use Doxygen in Eclipse but devlopment was been discontinued http://gna.org/projects/eclox
#### Doxygen is still being actively developed but no major feature chages are currently being pursued. 
#### One recent development with Doxygen is a graphical tool called Doxywiz that will facilitate the creation of a Doxygen Configuration file

* Doxywiz will usually install with the rest of the Doxygen package
