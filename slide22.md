# Benifits, Drawbacks and Future Developments (II)

***
#### A main problem with Doxygen is that it (ironically) complicates commenting of source code
* Comments are supposed to be easy to follow, but users who are unfamiliar with Doxygen will easily get confused.
* Doxygen itself has a steep learning curve, and the comments themselves are meant to be viewed outside of the source code.
* Best practice is to include some regular commentation that can guide a users looking only at source code.
* This also means you could end up commenting your own comments which is seems counter to the purpose of adding comments in the first place.

#### Doxygen will also not keep developers from writting bad code
* Doxygen is a lexical parser, it doesn't check for bugs or provide improvements

#### Doxygen is not well suited for small projects
* It takes a considerable amout of effort to get up and running in the first place
* It's ideal for projects that are long lasting and continue to grow such as libraries
