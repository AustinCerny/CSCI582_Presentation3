# Doxygen Basics (I)

***
#### Doxygen runs on Windows, OX S and BSD in addition to Linux but the program is run from the command line
#### Doxygen works natively for C, C++, Fortran, Java, Objective C, PHP, Python, IDL and VHDL
* Plugins can provide support for additional languages but they can sometime conflict with existing compilers for those languages
#### Doxygen works more or less the same across different languages and doesn't confict with the existing standards for how these languages are documented
