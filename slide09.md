# Doxygen Basics (III)

***
#### The template doxygen file has default values for most of the fields but the user needs to set up
* PROJECT_NAME:	Name of the project
* PROJECT_VERSION:	For use in version control
* OUTPUT_DIRECTORY:	Where output is stored
* INPUT:	Specify the code that doxygen is using to run on. This can be a single file, a list of files, or an entire directory of files which would be iterated through recursively.


#### The user has the option 
* INLINE_SOURCES: can code be embedded in the documents
* GENERATE_HTML: will output be generated in html. This is the defualt output format.
* GENERATE_LATEX: will latex be generated, the same options exist for PDF, RTF, Postscript (ps), XML, man pages and DocBook.

#### Other keywords/methods of setting up the doxygen configuration file can be seen here
